# Advent of Code 2022

Again I tried to find out how far I can make it in [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/). Results for previous editions:
* 2018: 9 days
* 2019: 13 days
* [2020](https://github.com/Leftfish/Advent-of-Code-2020): 25 days for the first time!
* [2021](https://github.com/Leftfish/Advent-of-Code-2021): 25 days for the second time!

Let's see if I can do it three times in a row...

At least during the first couple of days, I intend to implement the solution in Python first and then try to do the same in Java (just to see if I can still write anything remotely resembling it).

Things I **L**earned, **R**evised or **I**mproved at in 2022:

* [Day 1 Python](01/d01.py) | [Day 1 Java](01/Day01.java): debugging stupid mistakes (**R**) and not using list comprehensions to improve readability (**R**) in Python; reading a text file with BufferedReader (**L**) and sorting with Collections.sort (**L**) in Java
* [Day 2 Python](02/d02.py) | [Day 2 Java](02/Day02.java): not repeating myself (**R**) in Python (Gosh, what an ugly solution); using HashMaps(**R**) in Java
* [Day 3 Python](03/d03.py): set operations (**R**)
