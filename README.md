# Advent of Code 2022

Again I tried to find out how far I can make it in [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/). Results for previous editions:
* 2018: 9 days
* 2019: 13 days
* [2020](https://github.com/Leftfish/Advent-of-Code-2020): 25 days for the first time!
* [2021](https://github.com/Leftfish/Advent-of-Code-2021): 25 days for the second time!

Let's see if I can do it three times in a row...

Things I **L**earned, **R**evised or **I**mproved at in 2022:

* [Day 1](01/d01.py): debugging stupid mistakes (**R**) and not using list comprehensions to improve readability (**R**)
