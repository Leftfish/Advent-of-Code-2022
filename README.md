# Advent of Code 2022

Again I tried to find out how far I can make it in [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/). Results for previous editions:
* 2018: 9 days
* 2019: 13 days
* [2020](https://github.com/Leftfish/Advent-of-Code-2020): 25 days for the first time!
* [2021](https://github.com/Leftfish/Advent-of-Code-2021): 25 days for the second time!

Let's see if I can do it three times in a row...

During the first couple of days, I implemented the solution in Python first and then tried to do the same in Java (just to see if I can still write anything remotely resembling it). Then, I had to rely on hints and help from the awesome AoC community with day 11 (part 2).

Things I **L**earned, **R**evised or **I**mproved at in 2022:

* [Day 1 Python](01/d01.py) | [Day 1 Java](01/Day01.java): debugging stupid mistakes (**R**) and not using list comprehensions to improve readability (**R**) in Python; reading a text file with BufferedReader (**L**) and sorting with Collections.sort (**L**) in Java
* [Day 2 Python](02/d02.py) | [Day 2 Java](02/Day02.java): using Enum and IntEnum in Python (**L**); using HashMaps in Java (**R**)
* [Day 3 Python](03/d03.py) | [Day 3 Java](03/Day03.java): set operations in Python (**R**); using streams in Java (**L**)
* [Day 4 Python](04/d04.py) | [Day 4 Java](04/Day04.java): regular expressions (**R**) in Python and in Java (**L**)
* [Day 5 Python](05/d05.py): using lists as stacks (**R**)
* [Day 6 Python](06/d06.py): set operations (**R**)
* [Day 7 Python](07/d07.py): defaultdict (**R**) and that sometimes even if DFS looks like a go-to solution, it is not necessary it
* [Day 8 Python](08/d08.py): functools.reduce (**R**)
* [Day 9 Python](09/d09.py): Manhattan distance (**R**)
* [Day 10 Python](10/d10.py): some very basic OOP principles (**R**)
* [Day 11 Python](11/d11.py): modular arithmetic (**I**)
* [Day 12 Python](12/d12.py): unweighted graphs (**R**) and BFS (**R**)
* [Day 13 Python](13/d13.py): recursive functions (**R**), writing custom comparators (**I**) and using functools.cmp_to_key (**L**)
